# Developmental Work

The purpose of this directory is to store and developmental code that we use as a reference for our final project. This code may not be fully functional or optimized, but it serves as a starting point for our final implementation. We will use this code to test different ideas and approaches before we finalize our implementation for the project.

The current files in this directory include:
- `multi_input_neural_networks.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for implementing multi-input neural networks. We will use this code as a reference for our final implementation of the multi-input neural network for our project.

- `data_preprocessing.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for preprocessing our data. We will use this code as a reference for our final implementation of the data preprocessing steps for our project.

- `dnn_and_cnn.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for implementing deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks. We will use this code as a reference for our final implementation of the deep neural network and convolutional neural network for our project.

- `data_generators.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for implementing data generators. We will use this code as a reference for our final implementation of the data generators for our project.

- `dataset.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for importing and working with our dataset. We will use this code as a reference for our final implementation of the dataset handling for our project.

- `transfer_learning.ipynb`: This notebook contains code for implementing transfer learning. We will use this code as a reference for our final implementation of transfer learning for our project.

We use several libraries in our code, including:
- `numpy`: This library is used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- `pandas`: This library is used for data manipulation and analysis.
- `sklearn`: This library is used for machine learning tasks, including data preprocessing and model evaluation.
- `tensorflow`: This library is used for building and training our neural network models.
- `keras`: This library is used for building and training our neural network models, and it is built on top of TensorFlow.
- `matplotlib`: This library is used for data visualization and plotting.
- `seaborn`: This library is used for data visualization and plotting, and it is built on top of Matplotlib.
- `os`: This library is used for interacting with the operating system, including file handling and directory management.
- `cv2`: This library is used for computer vision tasks, including image processing and manipulation.
- `shutil`: This library is used for file handling and directory management, including copying and moving files.
- `sklearn.utils`: This library is used for shuffling our data during preprocessing.
- `librosa`: This library is used for audio processing and analysis, including feature extraction from audio files.
